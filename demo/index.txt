If all is well, you should see the test directory below.  

If things seem to be working, click on the "Login" icon.  The username is "admin" and the password is "password".   

You should click on the "Settings" icon and immediately change these. 

This text is read from a text file that must be named as set by in "Settings."  By default "index.txt".

A file call "zina_category" makes this directory a "category" listing.  You can delete that file and it will be treated like a normal directory.  You may also add it to any directory to do the reverse.

You may <b>delete</b> this file/folder or modify it to your hearts content.  You should also delete Artist One.  Both are for demonstration purposes.
